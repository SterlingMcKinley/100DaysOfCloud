Day1
The decision was made December 2, 2021 to enter into the cloud space. 

Eager to start this journey but more focused on being consistent to DEEP dive into cloud. I’m taking the time to learn each component at a micro level so that applying the concepts will be easy in the end.

Took a while to decide AWS or AZURE… 

AWS has a stronghold on the cloud platform. However, I see so many individuals and content working on Azure. I’m interested in both.

After researching and conversing with resource work with cloud every day, I’ve decided to start with AWS.

Started by understanding the exam and what will be covered. Currently, I am studying Cloud concepts.

To hold myself accountable I set a deadline to obtain my first cloud certification. 

Deadline: AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner by the end of 1st quarter 2022
