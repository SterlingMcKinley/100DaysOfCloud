Day 1
Eager to start this journey but more focused on being consistent to DEEP dive into cloud. 

I’m taking the time to learn each component at a micro level so that applying the concepts will be easy in the end.

Took a while to decide AWS or AZURE…

AWS is leading the cloud industry. However, I see a lot of content and individuals working on Azure. I’m interested in both.

After researching and conversing with resources that work in the cloud space everyday, I’ve decided to start with AWS.

Started by understanding the exam and what will be covered. Currently, I am studying Cloud concepts.

I feel adding a goal will help my cloud journey.

I started #100DaysOfCloud challenge on December 2, 2021 and on that day I declared AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner by the end of 1st quarter 2022!!
