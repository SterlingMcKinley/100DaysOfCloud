Day 19

My first lab post certification will be deploying a Kubernetes application.

I chose this hands-on tutorial/lab because I am extremely interested in containerization, Kubernetes & Openshift. 

I plan to be KCNA OR CKA certified by the end of June 06/2022.

Step to execute this tutorial:

1- Create an AWS IAM service role and a VPC
2- Setup Amazon EKS cluster Master Node
3- Install/Configure AWS CLI and  kubectl
4- Configure the EKS cluster with kubectl
5- Create EKS worker nodes
6- Launch a simple nginx application
