Day 20

Deploy Kubernetes cluster - Status: Complete

Step to execute this tutorial:

1- Created EKS master node & worker nodes
2- Created 2 AWS IAM service roles
3- create a kubeconfig
4- install/configure AWS CLI & Kubectl
5- Launch a simple application

I must admit it was a challenge being my first time utilizing Amazon EKS, Elastic Load Balancing & kubectl. 

I pushed through and figured it out. 

Today was a good day!
