Day 28

This lab continues my dedicated effort to obtain a better understanding of the AWS Well-Architected Framework 6 Pillars.

Today, I will focus on SUSTAINABILITY

AWS is responsible for sustainability OF the cloud. Customers are responsible for sustainability IN the cloud.

In this lab I will draw proxy metrics from AWS Cost & Usage Report (sample data) and prepare the data ready for dashboarding with Amazon QuickSight. Then I will add data and combine it with the AWS Cost & Usage Reports. 



-Create a new bucket in the Amazon S3 console. (Amazon S3 >  Buckets > Create bucket)

Update the bucketname and the region, leaving the rest of the paramter with the default settings. 

  - BucketName: mckinley-proxy-metrics-lab
  - Choose a region in which you will also run the Amazon Athena queries (later): US-East (Ohio) us-east-2
  - Press "Create"

-Upload sample data files to newly created S3 bucket (parquet files from a repository). The sample data or AWS Cost & Usage Report data "mckinley-proxy-metrics-lab" Amazon S3 bucket can be queried in the next steps.

-Navigate to Amazon Athena console ( ensure the previously utilized region is set to the same region my S3 bucket resides.)
  -choose Explore the query editor, then choose set up a query result location in Amazon S3 and follow the steps from the Amazon Athena docs to specify a query result location.

 -Since its my first time using Amazon Athena, I must set up a query result location in Amazon S3.
  -select Settings tab on the navigation bar.
  -Choose Manage
  -In the Location of query result box, enter the path to the bucket that created in Amazon S3 for query results. Prefix the path with s3://.
      -To ensure best practices for security, Under Encrypt query results, check both checkboxes,
  -Save

-Create a new AWS Glue database via the Amazon Athenaâ€™s query editor. Amazon Athena can connect to your data stored in Amazon S3 using the AWS Glue Data Catalog to store metadata such as table and column names. After the connection is made, your databases, tables, and views appear in Athena's query editor

First I must create an AWS Glue Crawler. In the query editor, next to Tables and views, choose Create, and then choose AWS Glue crawler.
