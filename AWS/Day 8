Day 8

My journey got a little foggy, bumpy and took a detour. Unexpectedly, I caught COVID. 

I was truly upset because I was learning and retaining so much information. 

After days/weeks of not studying, I feared I would become unmotivated because I forget the matrerial I covered

Two and a half weeks later, I recovered and was able to study again. 

My energy was low and I had a lingering cough but I fought through it.
