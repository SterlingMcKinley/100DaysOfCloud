Day 22

Lab: Deployed a Kubernetes Dashboard (web UI) via EKS & KMS

Attempted to exexute this this lab yesterday but ran into an issue. 

While troubleshooting that issue, I mistakenly deleted a VPC which added to the overall issue.

This morning I started over with fresh eyes, fixed the VPC and the issue that prevent deploying the Kubernetes Dashboard.
