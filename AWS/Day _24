Hands-On Lab: CLOUDFRONT WITH S3 BUCKET ORIGIN

In this lab, I hosted static web content in an Amazon S3 bucket, protected  and accelerated by Amazon CloudFront.

I chose this lab to examplify the Well-Archtected Security Pillar which applies best practices as well as meet business and regulatory requirements.
